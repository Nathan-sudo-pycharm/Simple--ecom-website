APP.JS

Apneck is a responsive full eccomerce website
This code is a React application that uses the React Router library to handle client-side routing. It defines several routes for different pages of the application, such as the home page, about page, shop page, contact page, login page, signup page, forgot password page, cart page, checkout page, blog page, and product details page.

The 
App
 component is the main component that renders the application. It uses the 
BrowserRouter
 component to set up the routing system and the 
Routes
 component to define the different routes.

Each route is defined using the 
Route
 component, which takes a 
path
 prop and a 
element
 prop. The 
path
 prop specifies the URL path for the route, and the 
element
 prop specifies the component to render when the route is matched.

The 
Layout
 component is a common component that is rendered around each page of the application. It contains the common elements such as the header, footer, and navigation menu.

The 
ScrollToTop
 component is a custom component that is used to scroll to the top of the page when the user navigates to a new page.

The 
ShopContext
 component is a custom context that is used to share data between different components in the application.

Overall, this code sets up a basic React application with client-side routing and a common layout component.

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable, simpler to understand, and easier to debug.
Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep the state out of the DOM.
Learn Once, Write Anywhere: We don't make assumptions about the rest of your technology stack, so you can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code. React can also render on the server using Node and power mobile apps using React Native.
Learn how to use React in your project.

Installation
React has been designed for gradual adoption from the start, and you can use as little or as much React as you need:

Use Online Playgrounds to get a taste of React.
Add React to a Website as a <script> tag in one minute.
Create a New React App if you're looking for a powerful JavaScript toolchain.
You can use React as a <script> tag from a CDN, or as a react package on npm.

Documentation
You can find the React documentation on the website.

Check out the Getting Started page for a quick overview.

The documentation is divided into several sections:

You can improve it by sending pull requests to this repository.

Examples
We have several examples on the website. Here is the first one to get you started:

import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

function HelloMessage({ name }) {
  return <div>Hello {name}</div>;
}

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('container'));
root.render(<HelloMessage name="Taylor" />);
This example will render "Hello Taylor" into a container on the page.

You'll notice that we used an HTML-like syntax; we call it JSX. JSX is not required to use React, but it makes code more readable, and writing it feels like writing HTML. If you're using React as a <script> tag, read this section on integrating JSX; otherwise, the recommended JavaScript toolchains handle it automatically.

Contributing
The main purpose of this repository is to continue evolving React core, making it faster and easier to use. Development of React happens in the open on GitHub, and we are grateful to the community for contributing bugfixes and improvements. Read below to learn how you can take part in improving React.
